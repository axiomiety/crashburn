## Rough Guide To The Weather

Notes taken whilst reading the book - unformatted (best viewed [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axiomiety/axiomiety.github.io/master/llog/book_rough-guide-to-the-weather.markdown) on github).

ISBN 1-85828-827-4

Thoughts: 
Introduction was pretty good - light, but with enough details and plenty of references. But as the book progresses, the depth that made the early passages so interesting is soon lost to rather woolly explanations (eg, El Nino, droughts  ...). The rest of the book was more of a reference for world climate and wasn't much interest to me. Great as a light introduction on weather and climate systems but not much more (which incidentally is exactly what this book is supposed to be!)

Ingredients

Weather vs Climate - "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get"
    Day to day change vs average over time

History:
    Glaciation (~10k yrs ago), sea level was > 100m lower
        Land bridges
            GB -> FR
            East Asia -> Alaska
            Australia -> Tasmania/New Guinea
    Warm-up from there on, break b/w 6200-5600BC
        Resumed -> rising Mediterranean into Black See (cataclysmic - possible link to Bible's flood?)
    'Meteorologica' by Aristotle ~340BC

Instruments:
    Thermometer
        Invented 1660 by Ferdinand II (sealed liquid in glass)
        Fahrenheit - 100 degrees (assumed air temp ~ above blood heat)
        Celcius - used water (freezing + boiling), 1.8 * Fahrenheit
        Kelvin - Celcius + 273.15
        Crickets - # chirps in 7s + 5 -> temp C
    Barometer
        Aneroid - expansion and contraction of sensitive bellows
    Hygrometer (humidity)
        Used human hair - stretches 2.5% in length as relative humidity goes from 0 to 100%
    Anemometer
        Built ~1450 Leon Battista Alberti (board hanging from wind vane - lever-like)
    Nephoscopes
        Speed + direction of cloud motion
    Ceilometers
        Beams of lights reflected off clouds

Atmosphere:
    90% of atmosphere (oxygen, water vapour, ozon) within 32km of surface
    Troposhere -> Tropopause (0 - 16km)
        1km rise means -6C drop
        Ozone maximum (30km)
    Stratosphere -> Stratopause (16 - 50km)
        Sunlight helps generate ozone by splitting oxygen molecules
    Mesosphere -> Mesopause (50 - 80km)
    Termosphere (80 - 650km)
        Geomagnetic storms (batch of magnetised plasma arrives via solar winds)

Weather maps: (eg MET office)
    H/L -> High/Low pressure - outward from high, inward from low
        Flow angles clockwise/ant-clockwise respectivley in Northern Hemisphere
    Lines are isobars - connect points of equal pressure
        Surface wind usually blows along isobars, but tilts slightly inward towards low pressure
            Strongest where isobars tightly packed
    Front
        Cold (blue/triangular)
        Warm (red semicircles)
        Occluded (cold front overtakes warm - purple with rectangles)

Humidity:
    Water vapour coexists with dry air (air 'holds' moisture)
    Warmer air -> more water vapour it can coexist with
    Every 11C air holds twice as much moisture (so 21C, max amount is 2x amount at 10C)
    90% relative humidity -> air holding 90% of the maximum amount of moisture it can at this temperature

Climate zones:
    ~70% of the planet's land area is in the Northern Hemisphere
        Land heats/cools more readily than water -> biggest temperature swings
    Ocean currents -> large contribution to climate
        Clockwise loops in N.E, ant-clickwise in S.E.
    Mountains are next biggest player
        Intercept moisture-laden winds (barriers - wet on one side, dry on the other)
    Large inland bodies of water
        Black Sea
    20% of land is desert
    Koppen classification (dry, tropical, rainy, warm temperate, snowy forest, polar + subdivisions)

The wild stuff

Rain:
    Hydrologic cycle - endless travelling loop
    Water evaporates from sea surface (80% of total vs lakes etc...) -> water vapour in atmosphere
        Each molecule takes a tiny bit of heat so warmer water -> more evaporation
    ~Week for a molecule to fall back as rain
    Raindrop is a lot water molecules joining together
        Happens in clouds
            Relative humidity ~100%
            Water vapour condenses on nearest particle (salt, soot, ...) -> cloud droplet
            Production caused by warm/cold rain
                Warm rain - in tropics
                    Cloud lower than freezing level
                    Droplets drop, bump, increase in size - ~30mns from cloud to raindrop
                Cold rain
                    Ice crystals formed - outnumbered by water droplets but grow faster
                        Vapour tends to be drawn to ice > liquid water in the presence of both
                        Snowflakes! But turns to rain as it descends through warmer air
        Starts as sphere -> oblong -> doughnut (without hole punched through)

Snow:
    Snowflakes can be identical in shape, but not necessarily at molecular level
    Hue is due to algae living in snow (blue, green, pink)
    Snowflakes begin life as single microscopic ice crystal - formed on mote of dust in cloud
        Not all air-born particles can support ice forming on them
    Grow by attracting water vapour -> sublimation (vapour straight to ice, no liquid phase)
    Temperature biggest contributor to shape
    NY subway was partly due to the blizzard of 1888
    Mountains typically have snow due to high altitude (cold air consistently) and peaks wring moisture out of ascending winds
    Avalanches - slopes of 30-45deg are most vulnerable (steeper slopes shed their snow)
        If buried, form breathing space with arms - snow melted by breath freezes and cuts off oxygen

Freezing Rain/Sleet:
    Ice pellets begin as snowflake
        -> fall into warmer layer and melts partially/completely
        -> hit ground-hugging layer of air with temp below freezing
        -> freeze melted snowflake into rounded solid mass
        Freezing rain is a particular condition of ice pellets
            Ground-hugging layer warm enough -> no time for melted snowflake to freeze before hitting ground
            Refreezes on surface (eg, exposed surfaces such as highway bridges)
            Danger to airplanes

Fog:
    Cloud on ground
    Caused by more water vapour than the air can hold (ie, moisture can't stay in vapour form) condensing on particles
    Water-attracting particles are called hygroscopic (eg, salt)
        Increase in those particles -> fog can form in humidity less than 100%/saturation
    Fog particles usually sink to ground ~1cm/second
        Cooling on top can keep it resplenished
        Lifting fog is really eroding (evaporation clearing its way upwards)
    Can be cleared by injecting fog with sprays of salt/ice/hygroscopic particles
        Goal is to attract moisture away from fog dropplets

Thunderstorms:
    Thunder and lightening
        Require cloud ~5km high
        Pull moisture into sub-freezing temperature
        Cumulus clouds (bubbly, cauliflower)
        Rise to where ice crystals can form -> cumulonimbus
        Ascent slows, cloud spreads into anvil shape
        Ice crystals form -> collide with unfrozen water droplets -> tiny electrical charges
        Cloud electric field increases -> lightning!
    Lightning comes in two forms
        Intracloud (IC) + Cloud to ground (CG)
        Electrons fall, met by positive charge from ground
        Return stroke (up) is the visible one
        Crooked shape due to path leader stopping a few times (avg 4) along path
            ~10% of CG leaders bring positive charge to ground
    Thunder is a shock wave
        Heat expands air near lightning flash
        Travels ~1km/3 sec
    Fulgura frango (I break up lightning - inscription on some church towers)

Hail:
    Begins life as tiny ice crystals
    Grows by encountering supercooled water droplets
        Strong storms -> air rising so quickly -> inflowing water vapour no chance to freeze
        Liquid at below freezing temperature
        Freezes on surface of hailstones
        Growth happens during ascension
    Can be formed of multiple layers due to multiple trips (ejected upwards, caught by inflow as they fall)

Tornadoes:
    Strongest winds on planet (~480km/h)
    Can only develop from parent storm
    Large tornadoes have multiple vortices that spin around the parent funnel

Hurricanes/tropical cyclones:
    Heat engine that sucks energy from tropical oceans
    Form over warm ocean (~26degC surface temp)
    Water holds more heat than air (much denser) 
    Extra heat when water molecule condenses as rain
    Require upper winds, but not so strong as to pull apart embryonic circulation
    Like a chimney - pulls warm, moist air into its centre
        Funnels air upwards through spiral rain bands and central eyewall
        Air spins outwards, forming shield of ice crystals
    Classification based on sustained winds speed
        62km/h -> tropical storm
        118km/h -> hurricante/typhoon/tropical cyclone
    Incubation areas ~10-30deg latitude north and south
        Earth's turning can impact cyclonic spin
    Tend to move westwards - and either north or south away from equator
    Deep patches of warm water (150m deep vs usual 30-45m) can provoke rapid intensification (less than 24h to monster hurricane)

Coastal storms:
    Low-pressure centres - west -> east at mid-latitude
    Lows form ahead of equatorward dips in upper-level jet sreams
    Need moist air to make it rain or snow
        Can use moisture from ocean, humid winds, large lakes, ...
    Vs hurricane, asymmetry in temperature not a problem (can pull in cold air vs warmth of ocean)
    Larger storms when low moves close to mass of cold air near cost
        Warm air rises above cold blob, heavy rain/snow wrung out

Windstorms:
    Descending air normally expands as it sinks -> warm up
    Downburst/microburst - cool, moist air descending from thunderstorm
        Up to 240km/h
        Rain evaporates and cools air below
        Danger to low flying aircrafts (headwind -> nose up -> tail wind -> reduces speed)
    Derecho - long-lasting windstorm

Floods:
    Caused by rain and landscape
    Landscape has absorption rate
        Dependent on urbanisation, soil type, recent weather, topography
    Only takes ~50cm water to float most vehicles

Drought:
    Loosely defined as rain stopping or diminishing to a certain degree for some length of time
    Flora and fauna adopt to long-term average rainfall in given local
    Can impact drinking water/crops
    

El Nino/La Nina
    Atmospheric cycles
    'Two sides of a coin'
    El Nino - surface water becomes warmer than average through eastern tropical Pacific (west from Ecuador coast)
    La Nina - opposite (same waters cooler  than average)
    Change in temperature not dramatic - 1-2degC for a weak Nino, 3-4degC for a weak Nina
    Impact is in geographic scope
        Tropical Pacific is broadest stretch of ocean
        Eastern winds push so mush water -> sea level on west ~50cm higher than on the east side
        Ends at western Pacific warm pool
        Deepening of warm pol - as far down as 200m
        Kink in thermocline (boundary between bodies of warm and cold water - sort of)
