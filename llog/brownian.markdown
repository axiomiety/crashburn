## Brownian Motion

## Standard Brownian Motion

$$B(t)$$ standard Brownian motion, then $$B(\sigma^2t)$$ is a Brownian motion with variance $$\sigma^2$$.

$$\tilde{B(t)} = \frac{B(a^2t)}{a}$$

Is also a standard Brownian motion for any $$a \neq 0$$. That means the Brownian motion can be characterised as a random fractal (we can zoom in and it's self-replicating!).

## Brownian Motion with Drift

## Geometric Brownian Motion

When modelling stocks, it does not allow for negative stock prices. And because it deals with ratios (not absolute differences), we have a percentage change in price.

$$S(t) = se^{X(t)}, t \leq 0$$

$$E[e^X] = e^{E[X] + \frac{Var(X)}{2}}$$
