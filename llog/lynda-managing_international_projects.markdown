## effective international leadership

### distributed leadership

Be clear about the decision making process
Process to validate decisions - needs to be inclusive
        * decision counsel
        * be clear on roles & responsibilities of leaders
        * which ones can be made locally
Adapt & manage risks of distributed leadership
        * inefficiency
        * lack of clarity
        * conflict

Reinforce the position of the distributed leader

### collaboration that works

Encourage initiative
Motivate people
Be clear about expectations, roles and responsibilities
Clear up contribution to team goals
Distributed leadership
Access to a decision maker
Build trust

### communicating across borders

Get the balance of information right (e.g. sponsors vs developers)
        * Short and locally relevant
Feedback loop
        * business risk with this direction?

### promoting value internationally

Encourage open discussions
Stakeholders need to be treated differently
Individual interest
        * decisive action
        * clear project hierarchy
        * understandable personal benefits
        * recognition
Group interest
        * clear defn of project objectives
        * clear roles & responsibilities
        * clear processes for collecting views and making decisions collaboratively

## adjusting your habits for international teams

### time zone dilemma

Set expectations - what you need, what they need (from you)
Understand schedules and personalities
What mode do they prefer - email, chat, powwow, phone, TP, WebEx, ...
What if something needs immediate attention?

Cannot avoid off hours
Use meeting times effectively - and plan accordingly (to minimise waste)
Record meeting minutes (*very* important! Can discuss minutes too)
Check in frequently to make sure communication is adequate - e.g. nobody feeling left out

### effective use of tools

Are the tools effective?
Do we spend more time entering info vs making use of the information?

### language standards

Verification - ask people to 'say it back' to check understanding
Vital to have common understanding
        * confirms understanding
        * adjust communication

### bridging cultures

Embrace change
Revise plans
Understand workday layout
Ask if cultural needs have been understood
Check mode of communication (such as more visual etc...)

## ongoing management of your international project

### assessing status

Most aware of things happening in your current location
Help team understand impact of activities on overall project

### when is face-to-face communication needed?

When conflicts escalate
To share good news! Don't restrict face-to-face to bad news

### finding and nurturing champions

3 kinds of people - enthusiasts, worrier, resistor
Champions - can see the value of the change & willing to help/support to make it happen
        * look for people not adverse to the change
        * can flag potential problems
        * people seeking personal growth
        * embrace skeptics
Different kinds of champions
        * operation-level - day to day
        * process - KPI changes, prioritisation
        * strategic (senior leaders) - reinforce

### transitioning to organizational change

Champions need goals, objectives, processes & systems
Knowledge is power
Tailored training (country/region/section/process)
Involve in project planning
Build support from local management
Champions can drive research to investigate variances
Encourage challenging of the status quo

## ensuring ongoing success

### evaluating your communication style

Communication style is a lot like colour blindness
Find what the team prefers
Email is dangerous, follow up rigorously
Review draft documentation
Be specific

### early trouble signals

Declined in meeting attendance
Ask for suggestions for improvements
Lack of communication between team members
Lack of momentum (no progress, roadblocks, ...)
Over budget! Mistakes and re-work you cannot see happening (e.g. bad decision hidden from you - or made by you!)
When team consistently seek assistance (e.g. look outside for help)
Sudden change in priorities/focus - review objectives

### managing international projects

Tips:
        * develop awareness of the situation in each major project location
                * project goals are sometimes not understood/embraced
                * sabotaged!

### recovering international projects

Align individuals to goals
Find common ground between stakeholders - basis for discussion/negotiation -> agreement
Leverage local management
Keep things moving - don't let it stall
Increase communication - particularly face-to-face
