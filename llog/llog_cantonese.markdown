Learning Log: Cantonese

At one point I was planning to work in Hong Kong and thought it might help me integrate better. The aim was for spoken only, given Cantonese uses traditional Chinese script. Long story short, I didn't end up going for work but for a vacation instead. As an ex-British colony I thought English would be widely spoken - but as it turned out I primarily used Mandarin to get around.

The sentence structure is very similar to Mandarin - there's a lof of "have don't have", "want don't want" - and more measure words than I care for.
