Learning Log: Korean

## Korean ##

Background: Towards the end of 2013 my wife and I decided to book a trip to Korea - but we weren't going to keep to Seoul. Instead we had a number of destinations, some more remote than others. And it quickly became apparent that English wasn't as widely spoken as we thought it would be - so I decided to give myself 4 months to pick up enough Korean to ask for directions, order food and do a bit of bargaining.

My primary textbook for this is the excellent [Korean From Zero](http://koreanfromzero.com/). I bought the book but there's a free version available on the website along with the audio recording.

#### Schedule ####

I'm a little short on time during the week and seldom get more than 20-30mns a day, which is spent revising/learning vocabulary. I tend to read the lesson over the weekend. It's really slow but steady.

#### Vocabulary ####

I load up all the vocabulary in [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) (along with the sounds) and transfer that to my phone. The review/learning process is relatively simple - every word/sentence I encounter I repeat out loud and write down 3 times. If I get a card wrong that means at the end of the session I would have written it down at least 6 times (3x the first time around, 3x during the review - more if I mess up the review). It's slow and tedious - but I find it sticks a lot better than how I used to do Mandarin!

The only downside right now is that my setup is geared towards reading and listening - so it's a lot in a very little out.

#### Pace ####

I started on the 23rd of November 2014. The first lessons are composed of lot of random vocabulary used to teach you how to read Hangul. I can't stress how important it is to be comfortable reading Hangul, even if you don't get the pronunciation right (I know I don't). Romanisation doesn't do Hangul any justice, and being able to read means you can access a ton of native material.

##### Dec 2014 #####

As of the end of December 2014, I'm pretty much done with the first handful of lessons (A through to 4). I have reached the point where I can greet/thank people, ask what this/that is and answer accordingly (like 아니요.사과예요 - no, it's an apple) but not much else. Vocabulary-wise I am around ~250 words though not all useful in day to day conversation (like tail - 꼬리, or landmine - 지뢰). Some of those are also compound words so it doesn't count as much (like America/American - 미국/미국 사람). But the method is good and the daily vocab reviews with Anki really help.

##### Apr 2015 #####

I finished the first half (A through to 10) and spent 2 weeks in Korea. So how helpful was 4 months' worth of Korean? Well. The hard truth is not *that* useful. Apart from asking what's good, where the bathroom is and where was the bus, it's been rather tough. What helped most was being able to read Hangul. Many signs aren't translated into English and unless you can read Hangul (phonetically), it's easy to get lost. 

In retrospective it might have been wiser to spend more time learning pre-canned sentences given the time-frame. However the grammar came in handy when I ended up picking up new words and managed to form sentences on the fly.

I am adding a dumping ground with a couple of things I picked up [here](korean.html).
