Dumping ground for some bits and bobs regarding Korean and 한글.

This won't be of much help if you don't have a rudimentary understanding of Hangul (the Korean writing system). To be fair it should probably one of the first thing you learn - if only because romanisation doesn't seem to make Korean any favours. It's phonetic and relatively simple to learn (really!). Now being able to pronounce syllables doesn't mean words will be pronounced right, but you'll be more than half-way there.

## Positions
* Add mnemonics

## Markers
* Topic

### Subject
~는 or ~은 are used to indicate the subject (or main person/thing) in a sentence.
~를 or ~을 are used to indicate the object in a sentence.

Example - I ate a dog, a dog ate me (swap the markers?) @italki

### Location

  * 안 = inside - 'o' is falling inside the box
  * 위 = on top - 'o' on top of 't' (t,o in top)
  * 밑 = below - 
  * 옆 = beside - 'o' is squeezed between 'y' and 'p'
  * 뒤 = behind - facing the wall
  * 앞 = in front - ball bouncing
  * 여기 = here

I'm in dire need of some mnemonics...

## Counters

  * 개 = counter for things
  * 명 = counter for people
  * 번 = counter for behaviors/actions (how many times something was done - like watching a movie)

The (native) numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 20 change when adding a counter:

  * 1 = 하나 -> 한
  * 2 = 둘 -> 두
  * 3 = 셋 -> 세
  * 4 = 넷 -> 네
  * 20 = 스물 -> 스무

## Apologising

  * For "I apologise/I should not have done that", use 죄송합니다. 
  * To get someone's attention (a waiter for instance), use 저기요. 
  * When passing through a crowd, it translates as "Just a moment/Just a second": 잠시만요/잠깐만요. 
  * "I'm sorry to hear that" is usually something like 오 진짜? 어떻게요? (which translates roughly into "Really? What to do?"). 

## Fun with Hangul

### Movie titles ###

I find Koreans don't tend to translate the titles of English movies. Instead they write the phonetic 'equivalent' in 한글.

   * 트랜스포터 (Transporter)
   * 미드나잇 인 파리 (Midnight in Paris)
   * 데몰리션 맨(Demolition Man)
   * 데어데블 (Daredevil)

### Phone language ###

Setting your phone in your target language can be a way to 'use' it every day.

## Gotchas
* Good, cold

## Random tips
* Switch methods periodically to fill in the gaps
