Learning Log: Mandarin

I started, full of enthusiasm, roughly 5 years ago. But as the saying goes, "Learning Chinese is a five-year lesson in humility".

Succesfully used in Sinapore, Hong Kong and Macau (so far!). You'd think English would be widely spoken, particularly in the last 2 but that wasn't the case. Even in Singapore, some of the smaller shops will almost speak Mandarin exclusively (especially if staffed by mainland Chinese).

Notes can be found [here](mandarin.html). And yes - I should have started that a long time ago.

#### Pimsleur Learn & Speak Mandarin I, II & III ####

That's a total of 90 lessons! 

#### Assimil - Le Chinois Sans Peine ####

#### Foreign Language Institute - Mandarin ####

That has to be the funniest of the bunch. It was written a while back and is as much a course in Mandarin as one in Chinese modern history. You'll be calling people 'Comrade' in no time and asking for direction to 'The people's store #2'.

It's also the most traditional method. There are numerous drills, and lots of repetition. Vocabulary-wise it's a little outdated but it's in the public domain so I can't complain.
